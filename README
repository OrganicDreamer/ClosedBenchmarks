closed_benchmark.pl -- A closed benchmarks generator
----------------------------------------------------------------------

closed_benchmark.pl is a free, open source script for creating closed benchmarks
to test network community detection algorithms.

Closed Benchmarks properties are described in detail in:

Files
=====

In this distribution you will find the following files:

README			- This file
closed_benchmark.pl	- The main Perl script
gpl.txt			- Description of the license
network1000.pairs	- Input network sample file
			  (network of 1000 nodes with clear 
			  community structure)
network1000.comm	- Distribution of nodes per community


Usage
=====

./closed_benchmark.pl -g graph_file -c comm_file -p number_of_points

Options:
    -h   --help           this message
    -g   --graph_file 	  file containing the input network to be converted
    -c   --comm_file      file containing the distribution of 
			  nodes per communities
    -p   --points         The program will print a certain number of 
			  intermediate networks during the conversion
    -w   --weighted       use this flag if dealing with a weighted graph
    -d   --directed       use this flag if dealing with a directed graph 
			  (still in Beta)


Example:
./closed_benchmark.pl -g network1000.pairs -c network1000.comm -p 99

This command creates, starting from the sample files, a closed benchmark with 
99 intermediate points (from 0 to 100)


Output files
=============

The execution of the script creates the following files:

- graph_file_initial.comm	file containing the initial partition 
				(distribution of nodes per community)
- graph_file_final.comm		file containing the final partition
- graph_file_percent.pairs	one file for each of the intermediate points.
				It contains a network (characterized by the 
				percentage of links rewired at that point)
